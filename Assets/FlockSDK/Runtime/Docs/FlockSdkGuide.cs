        public const string Overview =
@"Flock is a game backend. This SDK connects your Unity game to it for:

  • Player accounts & login (email, device, Google, Apple, Steam, Facebook, Discord)
  • Saved player data and player templates
  • A shop and player inventory
  • Remote game configuration you can change without rebuilding the game
  • Downloadable assets, and analytics

You set it up once in this window. It's then called from your game's code, while most
day-to-day content (game config, shop, templates) is managed on the Flock
dashboard rather than inside Unity.";

        public const string Configuration =
@"Fill these in the Configuration section of this window. All four come from your
game's page on the Flock dashboard:

  API URL       The Flock server address. Leave the default unless told otherwise
                (default: https://api-flock.qwacks.com).
  API Key       Identifies your game. Treat it like a password.
  Game Name     Your game's name (from the Flock dashboard).
  Game Version  Your game version name (e.g. 'v1.0.0'). Must match a version that
                exists on the dashboard.

These are saved into Assets/Resources/FlockConfig.asset.";

        public const string Setup =
@"1. Fill in Configuration above.
2. Click 'Add Flock Bootstrap to Scene'. This drops in a GameObject that starts
   the SDK automatically when the game runs — put it in your first/boot scene.
3. Re-sync from the Codegen tab in Flock > Settings whenever you change player templates or game config
   on the dashboard, or change Game Version, to regenerate the typed C# accessors.
4. Done — the SDK is ready to use (see Quick Start below, and the full
   documentation for everything else).";

        public const string Quickstart =
@"The shortest path once Configuration is filled in:

  // Easiest: click 'Add Flock Bootstrap to Scene' above — it initializes the SDK for you.
  // Or initialize once at startup in code (synchronous, no network):
  FlockClient.Create(flockConfig.ToInitConfig());

  // Log a player in — auth methods throw on failure.
  await FlockClient.Instance.Authentication.LoginWithDeviceAsync(""device-uuid"");

  // Read anything via FlockClient.Instance.
  var game = await FlockClient.Instance.Game.GetGameAsync();

Everything else — shop, player data, codegen, assets, offline cache, events — is
in the full documentation.";
